# Weatherly App 🌦️

Weatherly is a weather forecasting web application built with **React** and **Vite**. It uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to provide real-time weather updates, including current weather, a 4-day forecast, and an hourly forecast for any city searched. The app dynamically updates the UI with images based on the weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.). By default, it shows the weather for **Jaipur**.
